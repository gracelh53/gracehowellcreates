The fictious truth I chose is Paul Mccartney actually died in 1966 and was secretly swapped with a lookalike. The band then released songs that apparently hinted at Paul being dead. There are plenty of websites which have articles about this topic, and even Rolling Stone has one! I chose this conspiracy theory because I have always loved The Beatles and specifically Paul. I grew up on the band and keep tabs on Ringo Starr and Paul Mccartney on social media and whatnot.  I did not even know about this theory until a couple of months ago, my boyfriend told me whenever I was listening to one of their songs. I have heard similar theories like Arvil Lavigne. Another celebrity who people believe died and was replaced by a lookalike. I personally do not believe in this theory surrounding Paul, yet it is odd to think about and fun to read about. They claim Paul died in a car accident in 1966. The theories say he was on his way home from recording for Sgt. Pepper album. They claim he was replaced by the winner of the Paul Mccartney lookalike contest. The winners were William Campbell and Bill Shears. It was proven there was no lookalike contest,, and William Campbell does not even seem to be a real person. In 1969, the rumor really began to pick up speed and spread through radio. They talk about how in the album covers Paul is always the one with something off about him. In the Abbey Road cover, Paul is the only one shoeless and just out of line with the rest of the band. The Sgt. Pepper cover featured Paul as a walrus in black fur. They also focused on the song Glass Onion in the White Album with one of the lyrics saying, “Well here’s another clue for you all / The walrus was Paul.” Which referred to the Sgt. Pepper album cover. while the other band members were in white fur. I am not sure what fake group and/or organization is presenting this information. It could be an old recording company, an ex-girlfriend of one of the band members, or just a crazy fan. I cannot really think of anything or anyone else who would put this information out there. For the recording company, the band could have mistreated someone there or specifically Paul said something, and it made someone so mad they created a fake website saying he died. For the ex-girlfriend, Paul could have had a messy breakup with someone so terrible they decided to create the rumor. Maybe it is a fifth mystery member of the band who was cut last minute before they went public.  Finally, for the crazy fan, they could just be analyzing videos and photos from 1966, and claiming they know something the public does not. All these groups/people could benefit from this in some way, shape, or form. Whether that be money, fame, or just revenge on Paul Mccartney. The possible fifth band member could gain popularity with this rumor and have fans start paying attention to him. All of these people have the motive to create this theory and would gain something in return. I am leaning towards either the ex-girlfriend or the possible fifth band member because that would make the most interesting story and/or keep me interested in making the website.  I think this theory is a good one to do because I am extremely interested in Paul Mccartney, and I do not think I would get bored researching about his apparent death in 1966.
