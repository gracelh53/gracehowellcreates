	<h1>Facebook's Slow Death</h1>

After reading 404 Page Not Found by Kate Wagner, the most interesting subsection that caught my eye was the one titled “Revenge of the Old Internet?” She talked about how Facebook is mostly retired for younger generations due to the change of content on the app. Facebook is now filled with right-wing propaganda, fake news, misuse of data, and hate speech compared to its earlier days of the sleek professional app it once was. “’The Social Network’ is known now as a ‘Racist Boomerland’” (Wagner). The only people I know who have Facebook at my age are specifically to keep in contact with their older relatives, not so much for leisure time. She spoke about how people’s feeds are not made for one specific person, but it is a generalized home page filled with the same old game ads and information that your neighbor is probably because well. Similarly to Myspace, Facebook is on its way to a slow death. The design of Facebook used to be clean and easily read, but now with the “poorly designed, politically noxious, brainworm-ridden Facebook depravity<” as Wagner said. This involves badly made Memes, the overwhelming number of reactions you can use on a post, stickers in the comments, and frames have ruined the sleek, calm design of the original Facebook layout. On websites like twitter, Tumblr, and Reddit, people my age are creating sites specifically to make fun of old people on Facebook. The accounts are called things like “Cursed Boomer Images” or “Absurd Conservamemes” which just goes to show what type of content you will be seeing on Facebook nowadays. ANother popular, ugly image that appears on Facebook are memes of the Minions from the Despicable Me movies and the boomers have taken them over. Some Facebook groups are purposefully ugly with their aesthetics in a way to make fun of the real posts older people are creating on this app. “These groups are devoted to niche or surrealist humor, usually mocking the rest of the site’s aging denizens, or often rooted in a similarly vague (and deeply irony-poisoned) anti-consumerist or anti-capitalist,” (Wagner). They also have elevator music or Windows 95 to make it obvious they are making fun of them. Their profile photos are often low quality, grainy collages used to specifically make Facebook ugly looking. “These are the raucous, perhaps final stirrings of youth on a platform that is overcrowded and pungent with old person smell as a visiting school choir performance at the Kiwanis Club,” (Wagner). This made me laugh out loud when I read it for the first time because it is the perfect way to describe Facebook and the energy it puts out to the younger crowd. This article was an incredibly fun read, and I love how the author writes, her style is quite easy to follow along with.
