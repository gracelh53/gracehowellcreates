	<h1>CROCHET CRISIS: How Crochet is Becoming Fast Fashion's Latest Victim</h1>
</header>
<p>

	It is widely assumed that crochet projects can be mass-produced, but this is not true. Crochet machines do not exist! Unlike knitting, crochet products are far too complicated for machines to replicate the unique chains. On the other hand, there are knitting machines that can create a sort of faux crochet look to their garments. As a long-time crocheter, I sometimes find it challenging to determine if it is faux crochet or knitted. The message here is, buyer beware. Remember, when shopping at retailers like Forever 21, H&M, and, sadly, Target, know that you are perhaps being misled into purchasing something that is not truly what it says it is. Perhaps you don’t care if it is what it says it is; maybe you just want “the look.” In that case, you should understand the conditions in which crochet garments are produced.  By: Ireland Fleck

			<h1>Crochet is Not Fast Fashion</h1>

		<p> Crochet involves a hook and yarn used to create interlocking loops of yarn to create fabric. It is a handmade item which takes days if not weeks to see to completion. It is an art which requires patience and good hands. I have been crocheting for about a year and a half now, and I have already given myself carpal tunnel from crocheting for too long.  This is why it makes me so upset to see crochet articles of clothing in fast fashion websites or stores being sold for cheap. People often are under the impression that crochet can be made by a machine, but that is actually false. It can create similar stitches with knitting machines, but never will it be the level of intricacy crochet has when it is handmade.
