	<p>This website discusses the very real death of Paul McCartney in 1966. On his way back from a recording session of Sgt. Pepper Lonely Hearts Club Band he was in a horrific car accident which killed him. Furious with the studio kerfuffle, he floored it, went off into the night in a fit of rage and was killed in a car crash, some even saying he was gruesomely scalped during the crash. With the band floundering amid their pop peak, improbably, McCartney was then replaced by a lookalike called either William Shears Cambell (apparently referenced as Billy Shears on Sgt. Pepper) or William Sheppard (supposedly referenced in ‘The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill’). Luckily, he was a man who could not only look like Macca but sing and write songs like him too — quite the find. The Beatles had just begun their musical career in 1963 with their album “Please Please Me” and were becoming very popular all over the world</p>
