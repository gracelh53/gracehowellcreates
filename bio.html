  <p>i have been a creative person since i can remember. anything i could get my hands on i would try: rainbow loom bracelets, coloring books, tie blankets, painting a canvas for a family members, and so much more. if you knew me, you knew my 'thing' was creating. I graduated from Sauk valley community college with my associates in fine arts. i was accepted into columbia college chicago and I will be earning my Bachelor of Arts. i think i always knew i would pursue a career in the art field, and i am so thankful i am finally able to! i really enjoy working with yarn, making sweaters or stuffed animals, and also creating mixed media sculptures along with film and digital photography. I also love combining crochet and sculpture or crochet and painting! I also occasionally also dabble in painting.  self portraits have always been a form of art i can truly be free with. i find it interesting how i allow myself to be fully expressive when i create these photos alone. It makes one very self aware and i think it is a very powerful thing to photograph yourself. i hope people feel something when they look at my art whether that be good or bad i don't mind. from my photography to my sculptures i like creating pieces that feel whimsical and swirly.</p>
