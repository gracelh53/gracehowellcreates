		<p>This website discusses the very <b>real</b> death of Paul
			McCartney in 1966. On his way
	back from a recording session of Sgt. Pepper Lonely
	Hearts Club Band he was in a
horrific car accident which killed him. Furious with the studio kerfuffle, he floored it,
went off into the night in a fit of rage and was killed in a car crash, some even saying he was gruesomely scalped during the crash. With the band floundering amid
their pop peak, improbably, McCartney was then replaced by a lookalike called either William Shears Cambell
or William Sheppard</p>
		<p>Luckily, he was a man who could not only look like Macca but sing and write
songs like him too — quite the find. The Beatles had just begun their musical career
in 1963 with their album “Please Please Me” and were becoming very popular all
over the world. The first time the rumors of McCartney’s apparent death were given any real credibility in a public sphere was on Sept. 17th, 1969, when Tim Harper
wrote a piece referencing the rumor in the Times-Delphic, a campus newspaper
for Drake University in Des Moines, Iowa. Following this article, the rumor gained
more traction, and it was given an even larger audience when a caller by the name
of ‘Tom’ called into Russ Gibb, a radio DJ on WKNR-FM in Michigan and asked to
discuss the rumors of McCartney’s death. He pointed Gibb toward a song called
‘Revolution 9’ and told him to play it backwards. “I shoulda brushed the kid off,”
recalled Gibb, “He said ‘play the record backwards’ I said ‘what!’” The notion was a
strange one at the time, but Gibb dutifully played it backwards and heard the words
“number nine, number nine” turn into something different, “When I spun it backwards it said, ‘turn me on dead man, turn me on dead man’. I freaked.” In the music, there are the opening words of ‘Got To Get You Into My Life’ which state: “I was
alone, I took a ride, I didn’t know what I would find there”.</p>
