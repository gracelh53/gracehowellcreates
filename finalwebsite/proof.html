<section id=first><p>The line “he didn’t notice that the lights had changed” from ‘A Day in the Life’ and, on top of that,
the opening line of ‘She’s Leaving Home’ which supposedly highlighted the moment of the acci-
dent, “Wednesday morning at 5 o’clock as the day begins”. Meanwhile, ‘Lady Madonna’ reflects
on the suppression of the media with the line, “Wednesday morning papers didn’t come” and
at the end of their classic song ‘Strawberry Fields Forever’, Lennon can be heard muttering the
words “cranberry sauce”, which were interpreted as “I buried Paul”. A few more notes came with
the phrases” bury my body” and “oh untimely death” which appeared at the end of ‘I Am The
Walrus’, a snippet taken from a BBC production of King Lear completely randomly. The mutter-
ing continues, too. Near the end of their song ‘I’m So Tired’, John Lennon is heard saying “mon-
sieur, monsieur, monsieur, how about another one?” When the song was played backwards, it
was quickly heard as the now-iconic line: “Paul is dead, man, miss him, miss him”. Of course, on
‘Revolution 9’, there is the phrase “turn me on, dead man,” when played backwards, but it also
includes the sound of a car crash and explosion. Other lines from songs outside of The Beatles
have also added to the conspiracy, with Ringo’s song ‘Don’t Pass Me By’ apparently referring to
the accident as well.” I’m sorry that I doubted you, I was so unfair/ You were in a car crash, and
you lost your hair,” the lyrics state. the album cover consists of flowers which are supposed to
symbolize McCartney’s left-handed bass; at the bottom of the image, the Hindu God Shiva, the
destroyer, is pointing at Macca. Many thought the badge on McCartney’s arm read OPD standing
for “officially pronounced dead”, but, really, it came from the Ontario Provincial Police Depart-
ment.

  There are also apparent references to the time and date of McCartney’s alleged death, with
the original pressing featuring a picture of the band with Harrison apparently pointing towards
the previously mentioned lyrics “Wednesday morning at five o’clock.” Suppose you put a mirror
down the center of the Sgt. Pepper bass drum, you will get the phrase ‘I ONE X IX HE DIE’, which
many have interpreted as “11 9 HE DIE”, a reference to the date of the accident. With conspiracy
theorists building an arsenal of information, nuances continued over to the Magical Mystery Tour
record, which showed the word ‘Beatles’ written in stars which, if held up to a mirror, apparent-
ly gave you the number of a London mortuary. Many of the photos included in the booklet also
saw McCartney without any shoes on, a signifier of the dead in many cultures—but more on that
later. It’s in a still from the ‘I Am The Walrus’ sequence that this record gave most of its clues. The
image shows Ringo’s drum head apparently saying “Love the 3 Beatles,” while next to the kit are
McCartney’s boots covered in what appear to be bloodstains. Building on that, another image
of McCartney with a black flower in his lapel and one with him bearing a crack in his head also
added fuel to the fire. Admittedly these are some serious coincidences. The rumor mill clearly
kicked up a notch after The Beatles album Abbey Road hit the shelves—and the album’s artwork
didn’t disappoint. As well as the Volkswagen’s number plate in the image reading ‘LMW 28IF’,
which somehow was turned into ‘Linda McCartney Weeps’ and references the age Macca would
have been ‘IF’ he had lived—but he actually would have been 27. For many, it’s bigger than that.
For them, the shot represents a funeral procession, with John Lennon dressed all in white as the
priest. Ringo Starr in a black suit acting as an undertaker, McCartney being barefoot, as many
corpses would have been buried and still are, with George Harrison following behind as a grave-
digger. Add to this that McCartney was also out of step with the group, walking with his eyes
closed, and you can see how these things can get out of hand.
